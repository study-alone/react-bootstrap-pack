# Getting Started

Restart UI is a set of full featured, extensible, and accessible UI components, designed to integrate into any styling framework or system. Restart components, are "headless", meaning they don't provide any styles. Components encapsulate the complicated logic and and state without being prescriptive about their look and feel.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @repo/restart-ui -w
```

## Usage

Components can be imported from the main package or directly like:

```ts
import { Dropdown } from '@repo/restart-ui'
```

## Styling

Restart UI is a "headless" framework, meaning each component encapsulates logic and markup but not styling. Restart UI is intended as a basis for building design systems using which styling technology you like. You should provide your own styles, and the documentation provides some simple examples for how to do that. For more complex integrations, check out React Bootstrap.

There are a few places where inline styles are applied, however. They are functionally required and very minimal. Specifically PopperJs injects it's own styles in order to position overlays and dropdowns, and Modal applies overflow: hidden to the document body. These can technically be overridden but you probably won't need to.
